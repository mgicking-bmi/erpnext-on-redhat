## Running ERPNext on RedHat VM with a separate DB Server

### Prerequisites
 - A VM running RedHat
 - A VM running MariaDB
 - PuTTY or another TTY tool to connect to both VMs

#### Follow instructions for [App Setup](./AppSetup.md) and [DB Setup](./DBSetup.md)
_NOTE: I recommend starting with DB Setup, but you can start with App Setup and follow the link in there to setup the DB_ *PRIOR* _to initializing your new site_
